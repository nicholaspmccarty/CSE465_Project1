<h1>Z+- Interpreter Project</h1>
<p>This project focuses on developing an interpreter for the Z+- programming language, aiming to familiarize with the intricacies of interpreter design and the challenges of programming language development. The interpreter, which can be implemented in either Java or C++, is designed to execute Z+- programs, highlighting variable management, loop execution, and runtime error detection.</p>

<h2>Project Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a foundational understanding of how interpreters function.</li>
  <li>Explore the complexities involved in creating a new programming language.</li>
  <li>Implement core features of the Z+- programming language, supporting integer and string variables, assignment operations, and basic control structures.</li>
</ul>
